## Specialization
I build end-to-end products with cloud-first architecture and production engineering practices.

- Cloud: AWS serverless and managed services (design, build, secure, deploy)
- Infrastructure: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Backend: secure Node.js and Express APIs, auth, CORS-safe integrations
- Frontend: responsive and accessible React applications
- Delivery: CI/CD workflows with reliability and rollback in mind

## What I Do

- Cloud architecture using scalable serverless AWS patterns
- Terraform-based infrastructure for repeatable environments
- Backend API engineering with secure auth and clear service boundaries
- Frontend delivery focused on UX, performance, and maintainability

## Currently Exploring

- Advanced serverless patterns (Function URLs, API Gateway design, caching)
- Prompt engineering workflows and evaluation loops with Gemini
